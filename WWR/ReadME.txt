Estimation of Wrong Way Risk(WWR)

Gauging the exposure of derivatives upon jumps can be challenging.
This project focus on jumps caused by credit events, where underlying asset's price experienced a predetermined size of crash. 
CIR-type model is adapted to capture the arrival of default. 
Monte Carlo Simulation approach is applied to estimate size of loss.
In addition, I also measured sensitivity of 10+ model parameters. 
This project is written with MATLAB.
