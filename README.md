# Projects
They are listed in chronological order.<br> 
2018-Spring<br> 
CCVS: Conditional Corridor Variance Swap <br> 
2017-Fall <br> 
WWR: Wrong Way Risk;<br> 
TSRV: Two Scale Variance Estimator<br> 
2017-Spring<br> 
PP: Participating Policy, impicit scheme FD.<br> 
ELN: Dual-Equity Linked Note, explicit scheme FD.<br> 

Remarks:
Parts that I think interesting enough in these projects:

CCVS: Payoff structure changed, thus how to capture its dynamics with correlations?<br>
WWR: Paths that have contributed to the risk exposure are rare and stochastic, statistic estimating exposure may suffer from slow speed of convergence. <br>
PP & ELN: Insights of payoffâ€™s behaviour with changing inputs. <br>
TSRV: Trade-off between bias and variance; Source of noise and effectiveness of estimators.<br>

Furtherwork:

Will update more pieces of code, including data analysis part involved.
