Two Scale Realized Volatility (TSRV) Estimators.

TSRV smooths out the spike by cancelling out microstructure noise with estimators grouped by pre-determined time interval. However, arrival time of tick data is random. The estimator implemented is grouped by number of tickets. It is implemented in Python.
